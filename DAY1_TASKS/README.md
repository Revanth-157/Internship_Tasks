# Titanic Dataset - Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning

This project walks through the complete data preprocessing pipeline using the Titanic dataset. It's structured to help beginners understand how raw data is cleaned and prepared before applying any machine learning model.

## 🧭 Project Flow

The following steps outline how the dataset was handled:

🔹 **Step 1:** Load the Titanic dataset and review its structure (data types, missing values, sample rows).  
🔹 **Step 2:** Deal with missing data using statistical techniques such as filling with mean (for numerical) and mode (for categorical).  
🔹 **Step 3:** Transform categorical values into numerical ones, using both label replacement and one-hot encoding techniques.  
🔹 **Step 4:** Apply feature scaling to bring numerical values like age and fare to a comparable scale.  
🔹 **Step 5:** Plot boxplots for each numeric feature to identify outliers, and remove them using IQR filtering.

## 💬 Common Interview Topics Covered

Here are some relevant concepts you might be asked in interviews based on this project:

- **Types of Missing Data:**
  - MCAR, MAR, and MNAR (completely at random, at random, not at random).
  
- **Encoding Categorical Columns:**
  - Label encoding assigns numeric values (e.g., male → 0, female → 1).
  - One-hot encoding creates separate binary columns for each category.
  
- **Normalization vs Standardization:**
  - Normalization scales data to a fixed range (0 to 1), while standardization centers it around the mean with unit variance.
  
- **How to Spot Outliers:**
  - Visual tools like boxplots, and statistical methods like the IQR or z-score technique.
  
- **Importance of Preprocessing:**
  - Preprocessing improves data quality, ensures consistent input formats, and increases model performance.
  
- **Dealing with Imbalanced Data:**
  - Techniques include oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights during model training.

- **Impact of Preprocessing on Model Accuracy:**
  - Quality preprocessing can significantly enhance a model’s ability to generalize.
